        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <article>
          <p>My interest in IT started with my Graphic Design diploma – I wanted to make websites. That slowly became something I was interested in whilst I studied but nothing really came of it. Then, with all my experience with people with disabilities - I realized how IT can open one’s world up. I saw the differences that IT was making for my clients (and even myself) during the hardest, loneliest times.  These were the two main factors that sparked my interest in IT. </p>
<p> Earlier this year I started an Associates degree in Cyber security with UTAS. I did a beginners course in Programming, where we focused on Python. Although I really enjoyed it (even if it was hard) I felt like IT was something I could really sink my teeth into, so I took a risk an applied to study at RMIT. The degree can be studied from home which suits me perfectly, it’s got a wide variety of course material, and I can finally learn how to make websites. I also can incorporate more IT into my work life and help those I look after. I also have heard great things about RMIT from locals and friends, so I felt like I could trust the Uni to teach me well. </p>
<p>I expect to learn a whole new way of  interacting with technology around me. I believe there is much that I don’t know about IT which I will be fascinated to find out about. I hope to learn much about gaming, website development, and cyber security. </p>
