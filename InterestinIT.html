        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <article>

        <h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
          <p>My interest in IT started with my Graphic Design diploma – I wanted to make websites. That slowly became something I was interested in whilst I studied but nothing really came of it. Then, with all my experience with people with disabilities - I realized how IT can open one’s world up. I saw the differences that IT was making for my clients (and even myself) during the hardest, loneliest times.  These were the two main factors that sparked my interest in IT.</p>
          <p>With designing websites, I was in the firm belief that they worked like photoshop when I first started my graphic design career. Big mistake I know. I thought you created elements by sizing them up on screen and choosing colours from a colour wheel. When I found out they were coded, I was shocked. But also intrigued. I always had thought coding was for computer scientists. It was never in reach for  me. However, about a year ago, I signed up to code academy, when I had my first foot surgery. It put me out of action for physical things, but I sat on my little MacBook and went through the HTML and CSS portion of the course. I loved it! It was so strange for me, as it was completely different from photoshop, but it was rewarding. Now, I have a big PC and even bigger dreams for being able to code. I think it’s rather exciting!</p>

        <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
        <p>Earlier this year I started an Associates degree in Cyber security with UTAS. I did a beginners course in Programming, where we focused on Python. Although I really enjoyed it (even if it was hard) I felt like IT was something I could really sink my teeth into, so I took a risk an applied to study at RMIT. The degree can be studied from home which suits me perfectly, it’s got a wide variety of course material, and I can finally learn how to make websites. I also can incorporate more IT into my work life and help those I look after. I also have heard great things about RMIT from locals and friends, so I felt like I could trust the Uni to teach me well.</p>
        <p>Home learning is a big factor for me. Due to my mental health (and the fact that I just had a second surgery on my foot, meaning I can’t travel) I need to be able to study from home. I’ve created a safe, easy going environment, which for me means mental health peace. There were a few Universities to choose from, to study IT. I choose RMIT, purely because I have a few high school friends, who went to Melbourne to study there. I saw them progress through there degrees on Facebook, and it seemed comprehensive and fun. </p>

        <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
        <p>I expect to learn a whole new way of interacting with technology around me. I believe there is much that I don’t know about IT which I will be fascinated to find out about. I hope to learn much about gaming, website development, and cyber security. I also expect to learn skills including teamwork, communication and problem solving. </p>
        <p>I am not one of those people who are not naturally in tune with computers or technology. I respect it, but I don’t vibe with it. I do however, want to learn, and I have A LOT of patience. I’m hoping that is enough to get me through this course. I feel like if I keep studying this course, I will pick up some real skills with technology surrounding cyber security, networking and more soft skills like problem-solving, critical thinking and resourcefulness.
