<h3> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h3>
<p>The role is for an experienced front end developer. It’s a position that requires extensive teamwork, as the work can be remote. But it can include meet up days with other developers and a cheeky Christmas party too. I would love to work from home due to mental health issues and it means I can look after my dog and house.
 The role is about creating websites, apps, online stores and custom built applications. It includes working with back-end developers and UI/UX designers collaboratively to bring the websites or applications to life. I personally love the variety that this job is offering. They seem to have many roles going at once which means a variety of different jobs. It requires a strong knowledge of different languages which again, appeals to me as I want to learn how to program not only websites, but applications as well.  </p>
 <p>
Overall, Ionata are offering a remote working job, which requires sound knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They also are looking for applicants with experience with Vue, React or Angular. All these skills are available for me to learn through this degree at RMIT, and through some self study as well. This makes the job appealing because I know one day, I’ll have these skills and I’ll be qualified to do this work. It’s an exciting prospect!

<h3> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. </h3>
 <div id="bullets">
        <p>
 The job requires the following skills, qualifications and experience:

          <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS and Javascript – the backbone of frontend development</li>
            <li>Frameworks such as Vue.js, React or Angular. </li>
            <li>GIT hub experience</li>
            <li>Teamwork – as mentioned above, it will mostly be remote work, so this one is very important to have.</li>
            <li>A few years experience, and a few websites/applications that were mainly your work.  This is so the company can see your ability to create. Also some experience with frameworks.</li>
            <li>General designing skills like UI/UX</li>
          </ul>

</div>

         </p>
          <h3> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. </h3>
<p>I currently have zero hard experience in IT. I do however have a little experience with Python, meaning I can make (very) small programs. I have a diploma of Graphic Design which gives me an eye for colour and design. I can use Adobe Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator. These skills were acquired a while ago, but I am still relatively familiar with them. </p>
<p>I have worked in teams since I was 15 professionally and feel as though I have great interpersonal skills. I am a hard worker and did very well in high school academically. These skills have been reenforced with the several years of studying a variety of degrees and certificates. I feel like I have the starting building blocks, and this course will help me define and grow. </p>


<h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position,building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h3>

<p>
The first step would get further into this degree of IT. Taking classes that become the building blocks to my first websites and applications. During my time at University, I should have little assignments and maybe even a little paid work, creating smaller applications and websites, and using all the tools I will need for larger works. I will learn a few different languages for coding, including, HTML, CSS, Java, and Python. I will have a portfolio on Github where potential employees can see my personal and collaborative work.  I will be using my spare time to solving problems, or creating personal work. When I graduate, I envision myself getting a ‘junior’ role at a company, following the lead of an experienced developer. I will do this for a few years, getting more and more knowledgeable until I am ready to take on my first job as an ‘intermediate  front-end developer’.
