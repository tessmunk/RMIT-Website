        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.  </p>
          <p> There are millions of Australians each year who take medication, prescribed or otherwise. Keeping track of medication is a real issue facing Australians, and a simple app could fix that. Having an app that you can input medication types, track when their taken, set reminders for more and alert  users when their script is nearly over, could be lifechanging. By making alerts for the user, they can rely on the application instead of mentally doing so. Human mistakes are plenty and are normal, this app would alleviate human error. Having the app on a phone allows for easy access, and could potentially save someone from an overdose. </p>
          <p>Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may </p>
          <p>Keeping track of what medications that a person has taken can be difficult, and misusing medication is dangerous. The inappropriate use of medication in Australia costs the government $1.2 billion per year (Cutler et al., 2019).  By creating a simple app, usable for most Australians, the inappropriate use of medication can be lowered. This app can be used by the patient themselves, or could be used in a group setting like a carehome or hospital.  By improving adherence, hospitalizations and healthcare expenditure can be lowered (Hsieh et al., 2022). The use of the app can help everyday Australians keep track of what medications and when they, or their loved ones have taken them. </p>
          <p>Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service</p>
          <p>This application will be downloaded onto a users phone and will be heavily controlled by the users input. The app itself has two main components. One alarm system for when scripts are 5 days out from running out, and a medication tracker. The medication tracker has what medications they’re on, what times of day you take them, and a way to ‘complete the task’. </p>
          <p>The first component is the alarm system. When entering medication, the app will link up with the pharmacy and ‘read’ the script that the doctor prescribed. This script will now know how many days of the medication they have left, and if there is a repeat, the app will alert the user through a notification system. This means they can get to a pharmacy with enough time or go to a doctor if they have no scripts left. </p>
          <p>The second component is the tracker itself. A user will enter a medication, i.e Haloperidol 5mg, and the app will then find the script from the pharmacy. The user will confirm how many times a day the medication will be taken. For example morning (7am), lunchtime (1pm), and evening (7pm). At these times, the app will send a reminder through the phone that the Haloperidol needs to be taken. The user will click on the reminder, and will ‘tick off’ taking the medication. The app will remember the time and dose which has been taken, leaving it visible to the user (and potentially doctors). This results in a ‘paper trail’ of medication taken, and eliminates mishaps. This app could also be used with just Panadol for example, meaning there will be a record of the person taking the Panadol, tracking what time and when a next dose is available. </p>
          <p>The app is useful for a single user but could potentially be used in a wider circumstances. Those who work in aged or disability care could perhaps have ‘user accounts’ for clients/people in their care.  Medicines could be tracked through the app for clients, and a whole care home could be tracked with this app. This also has potential in mental health instances, where the psychiatrist could be notified with abnormal behaviour or missed medication. Using the app on someone’s behalf as a guardian or caregiver could save the easy mistake of forgetting whether or not the client has had their medicine, or forgetting what time they had their last dose.</p>
          <p>Overall this app will allow for a tracked, organised and efficient way to keep medication in toe. By allowing the user to have complete control of this app, the success behind it relies on their activity, but in the technological world of today, nearly every person has their phone on them. Places like nursing homes are introducing technology, and this very simple app could assist those vulnerable in Australia who need to keep track of their medication. This app would eliminate the easy human errors which happen daily, and remind users of the importance of proper medication takings. </p>

          <p>Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate. </p>
          <p>To make an app there are several steps included. A computer for coding is at the heart of  building an app. The hardware must be capable of ‘handling’ an app, and be up to date with the latest software.  After the initial planning stage, the app is divided into two spaces, frontend, and backend. Although an app builder such as Quixy, Zoho Creator or AppyPie can be used to develop the application. At the end of the initial building phase, the app must be tested on the hardware it will be used on. So android and iPhone should be used to test the functionality of the app.  </p>
          <p>Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required? </p>
          <p>To make an app is difficult, however with the right know-how, the process can be smooth. Firstly, the developers must know a programming language that the app will be built with. These skills are taught in universities and can be self taught as well. Finding a team that can bring the different skills such as coding, UI/UX design and marketing is paramount to the success of the app. The app will also have to link up with pharmacies and doctors, requiring a level of security. Finding hardware is easy as nearly everyone has mobile phones nowadays. </p>
          <p>Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
          <p>If this app is successful, it will become a must have for people who take multiple medications, group homes, aged care facilities, and anyone who has a hard time remembering when they took their last dose. It will become a staple for carers and help track medication for you and old Australians.  Doctors will refer patients, and pharmacies will use the app as standard. It will help alleviate misuse of medication for the Australian public and will lower the number of incidents had. This will in turn help our healthcare system, Medicare, doctors surgeries, and pharmacies. </p>
