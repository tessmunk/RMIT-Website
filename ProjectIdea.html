        <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Overview (100 words) - This should be a summary of what the project will be.  </h3>
          <p> Everyday, millions of Australians use their mobile phones for a wide variety of activities. People who suffer from mental illnesses are known to rely on their mobile phone moreso than those without an illness (Alavi et al., 2020). Those with mood disorders and schizoaffective disorder have highs and lows in their moods frequently. The aim is to make an app, which is designed to track the use of the phone, observing differences from ‘normal’ usage, which will detect a change in mood stability. Through this, a patients guardian, doctor or friend can be alerted of a change in usage, and act accordingly.  </p>

          <h3>Motivation (100) words) - This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful. This may </h3>
          <p>Being able to detect a change in mood early for people with such disorders could be lifesaving. Emotional volatility is a key feature of these disorders (Malik, Goodwin and Holmes, 2011). If a change is detected for example, with erratic or radio silent texting (which differs from the baseline), those who can help can be alerted early on. This means the sooner they can detect a mood swing, or a step in the direction of a psychotic episode, the sooner help and invention can be organised. It has been proven early intervention saves lives and gives a person the best chance of recovery (McGorry, Killackey and Yung, 2007). </p>

          <h3>Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service</h3>
          <p>This app would be a step in the right direction for someone who is undergoing treatment for a mood disorder such as schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder. The app would have to be installed on the phone with the users consent. A safety person, such as a guardian or a doctor would agree to receive updates on the usage of the phone. The phone would then app several different area’s on the phone, and would only alert the ‘safety’ person if the app detects use outside the baseline use. This ‘high-risk’ behaviour could then be detected earlier than normal, thus allowing an earlier intervention. </p>
          <p>The app would be given access to several spaces on the phone. It should be able to detect a change in texting and messaging. For example, the user would stop talking and messaging as much to friends and family, or they might be messaging everyone in their message bank.
          <p>The app could also make judgements on other areas of the phone, as in money spending and exercise. It is well known that those with disorders engage in high risk behaviour, and something as small as buying too many clothes can become a recognisable trait which can send an alert to that safe persons phone. The app could connect to a smart watch too, and if it detects a significant  change in steps, an alert can be sent again. The high risk behaviour could even be linked to gambling more money than normal. </p>
          <p>The whole point of this app is to set boundaries and ‘connect the dots’ when those boundaries have been crossed. A user could track their usage when healthy, over a month. This would set the precedent for the app. Then, if the phone detects an abnormally, the safety person can be alerted.  This can work with an range of features or aspects of the phone: financial, mood trackers, messaging, and others. It should also be able to be manually adjusted for some abnormalities, such as a big purchase of a car for example. </p>
          <p>In the most serious of cases, I believe the app can save lives. It can be programmed to look for key words like ‘suicide’ or cases of hurting oneself. The app can then send the alert, and perhaps even suggest a helpline or to call the safety person. </p>
          <p>Overall, tracking the behaviour of a ‘normal’ month and then looking for outliers to detect a high risk behaviour is a way tracking if someone needs help or not. The app can be used just between family members, or even in professional relationships such as a patient and psychiatrist. By entering in the parameters for this app, the ongoing, day to day life of the patient is not affected, and everyone included can stay up to date with the latest information. </p>

          <h3>Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate. </h3>
          <p>To make an app there are several steps included. A computer for coding is at the heart of  building an app. The hardware must be capable of ‘handling’ an app, and be up to date with the latest software.  After the initial planning stage, the app is divided into two spaces, frontend, and backend. Although an app builder such as Quixy, Zoho Creator or AppyPie can be used to develop the application. At the end of the initial building phase, the app must be tested on the hardware it will be used on. So android and iPhone should be used to test the functionality of the app.  </p>

          <h3>Skills Required (100 words) - List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required? </h3>
          <p>To make an app is difficult, however with the right know-how, the process can be smooth. Firstly, the developers must know a programming language that the app will be built with. These skills are taught in universities and can be self taught as well. Finding a team that can bring the different skills such as coding, UI/UX design and marketing is paramount to the success of the app. The app will also have to link up with pharmacies and doctors, requiring a level of security. Finding hardware is easy as nearly everyone has mobile phones nowadays. </p>

          <h3>Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</h3>
          <p>If successful, the outcome will be another lining of protection for the most vulnerable in society. Those with mental disorders often feel alone and are incapable of regulating a psychotic episode. This app will help them, by notifying someone important of the early danger signs of an episode and can get the ball rolling with getting the help that’s going to see them be safe. The tracker can be a tool used in the tool belt of a professional, when helping those who need it most.  </p>
