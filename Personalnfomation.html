Hello! I’m a 28 year old woman from the Central Coast of Australia. Although I was born in Australia, my mother is Danish and I can speak a little bit. In 2016 I spent a year in Sweden working as a nanny so I can speak some bad Swedish too.
I’ve studied many different things including law, teaching, visual arts and I even managed to complete a diploma of Graphic Design.
In 2017 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and have been working closely on healing and looking after myself. Ironically, I work in disability helping those who are most vulnerable.
