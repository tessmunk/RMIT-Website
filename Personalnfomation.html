            Hello! I’m a 28 year old woman from the Central Coast of Australia. Although I was born in Australia, my mother is Danish and I can speak a little bit. In 2016 I spent a year in Sweden working as a nanny so I can speak some bad Swedish too. I love learning about new languages and travelling I’ve been many places around the world, but my two favorite places are Japan and Norway. Japan is a favorite because I studied Japanese in Highschool and I went as a student to a high school over there. Norway was a favorite because I traveled through the country in a car and got to experience the fjords and nature in a completely different way. </p>

          <p>  I’ve studied many different things including law, teaching, visual arts and I even managed to complete a diploma of Graphic Design.  I like to study but seem to have a problem with losing interest after a while. However there is something about coding that I find addictive. And I have never studied from the comfort of my own home – so I am keen to continue this course. </p>

          <p>  In 2017 I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and have been working closely on healing and looking after myself. Ironically, I work in disability helping those who are most vulnerable. I did well in high school and the HSC, meaning I found it easy to study and pay attention. Since being diagnosed, I have had a hard time staying focused and leaving the house. However, I have found a job I can work from home with, and I have found this course. Both can be done from home and I find myself loving my situation. It would be easy to be doom and gloom about it, but with the right treatment and ways to keep busy, I can lead a normal happy life. </p>
